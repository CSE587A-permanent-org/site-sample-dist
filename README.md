# Site Sample

You will find the assignment instructions in
[site_sample/assignment.ipynb](site_sample/assignment.ipynb). As with
the other labs, the only code which will be graded is in
[site_sample/assignment.py](site_sample/assignment.py). You need to write code
in that file such that the tests in
[site_sample/test_assignment.py](site_sample/test_assignment.py) pass.
